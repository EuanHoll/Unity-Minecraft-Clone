# Unity-Minecraft-Clone
This was made following a tutorial with my own modications. Fell free to use it for your own projects. I would like it however (not required) that you send me a copy of the game when finished :)

Check out the license for informationg regarding that.
If you are feeling like buying me a sandwich here is my donate link

I would like to be able to play the games or any other software using this software but that is not required :p
